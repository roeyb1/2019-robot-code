# CRC Robotics - Robot Code
2019 CRC Robotics robot code. Written for the VEX Cortex in C using the PROS API. Specifically includes movement controls for mechanum wheels. In addition, the Cortex has to communicate via digital signals with an on-board Arduino to simplify some calculations as well as enabling the use of certain other sensors.
